# The Babel Library: Generative Linguistics Through Ido

A collaborative computational linguistics research project by **Oscar Eduardo Bernal** (B.Eng. Systems Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira) and **Luis David Cardona** (Linguistics, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, Colombia).

## Abstract

This interdisciplinary research project explores the intersection of computational linguistics, constructed languages, and procedural generation through the lens of Jorge Luis Borges' conceptual framework in *La Biblioteca de Babel* (1941). We propose a systematic approach to generating linguistically valid textual structures within the constraints of the Ido constructed language, employing deterministic algorithms to create reproducible linguistic artifacts that maintain grammatical coherence while exploring the boundaries of meaning construction.

## 1. Justification of the Project

The predominant approaches to natural language generation in contemporary computational linguistics rely heavily on statistical models and neural networks that operate as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand the internal decision-making processes. This project represents a deliberate return to first principles, establishing a controlled linguistic environment where generation occurs through transparent, rule-based mechanisms with complete structural accountability.

Ido serves as an ideal medium for this research due to its:

1. **Computational Tractability**: Unlike natural languages with their irregularities and exceptions, Ido's systematic grammar enables complete formalization in computational terms.

2. **Controlled Complexity**: The language offers sufficient expressive power while maintaining a level of complexity that can be fully modeled within a rule-based system.

3. **Scalable Foundation**: The methodologies developed can serve as foundational work for extensions to other constructed languages and eventually to natural language domains.

4. **Pedagogical Value**: The transparent rule system creates an accessible environment for teaching concepts in computational linguistics, formal grammar theory, and natural language processing.

This research aims to bridge the gap between symbolic AI approaches and contemporary neural language models by demonstrating how rule-based systems can generate meaningful linguistic structures with full transparency and reproducibility—qualities increasingly important as AI systems become more integrated into communication technologies.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

This investigation builds upon Borges' metaphorical infinite library containing all possible textual combinations. Rather than the random combinatorial approach in Borges' conception, we implement a constrained generative system bounded by:

1. The formal grammar of a constructed language (Ido)
2. Deterministic procedural generation algorithms
3. Structural linguistics principles
4. Computational approaches to meaning representation

> "The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries…" — *Jorge Luis Borges*

Our implementation represents a controlled subset of this conceptual space—a systematically navigable section of the infinite library that produces texts with increasing levels of linguistic validity.

## 4. Methodological Selection: Ido as a Research Instrument

Ido, a constructed international auxiliary language derived from Esperanto, offers specific methodological advantages for this linguistic investigation:

### 4.1 Structural Characteristics

- **Regular Morphology**: Systematic and predictable word formation patterns
- **Consistent Grammar**: Rule-based structure without exceptions or irregularities
- **ASCII Compatibility**: Absence of diacritical marks or special characters (unlike Esperanto's circumflexes: ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ)
- **Simplified Phonology**: Clear grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence

### 4.2 Computational Advantages

- **Deterministic Parsing**: Unambiguous tokenization and syntactic analysis
- **Encoding Efficiency**: No requirement for Unicode normalization or special character handling
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Consistent representation across all computational environments
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Reduced complexity in pattern matching and text manipulation

### 4.3 Linguistic Properties

- **Morphological Regularity**: 
  - Uniform verb conjugation patterns
  - Systematic noun pluralization
  - Consistent adjective agreement
  - Regular derivational morphology

These properties establish Ido as an optimal experimental environment for computational linguistic research, offering a controlled space for investigating language generation without the statistical noise and irregularities inherent in natural languages.

## 5. Implementation Architecture

The system architecture comprises four primary components:

1. **Lexical Database** (`words.yaml`)  
   Hierarchical categorization of vocabulary by grammatical function and semantic domain, including:
   - Parts of speech classification
   - Morphological features
   - Semantic categorization

2. **Syntactic Templates** (`structures.yaml`)  
   Formalized generative structures with optionality markers:  
   ```
   {determiner?} {adjective?} {noun} {verb} {adverb?}
   ```
   Implemented with a domain-specific notation for structural variation.

3. **Morphosyntactic Rules** (`grammar.yaml`)  
   Formal implementation of:
   - Inflectional morphology
   - Agreement systems
   - Syntactic constraints
   - Combinatorial restrictions

4. **Generation Engine** (`sengen.py`)  
   Deterministic procedural generator utilizing cryptographic hashing for:
   - Reproducible sentence construction
   - Structural composition
   - Rule application
   - Coherence evaluation

## 6. Limitations and Methodological Considerations

While this research offers significant advantages through its controlled approach, several limitations and methodological considerations must be acknowledged:

### 6.1 Representational Limitations

- **Artificial Language Boundary**: Findings may not generalize directly to natural languages due to Ido's constructed nature and absence of historical/cultural evolution
- **Semantic Scope Constraints**: The initial lexical database necessarily limits the semantic domains that can be explored
- **Pragmatic Dimension**: The system currently lacks mechanisms for modeling pragmatic aspects of language use (context, speaker intention, etc.)

### 6.2 Technical Constraints

- **Deterministic Framework**: The absence of stochastic mechanisms may limit the system's ability to model natural language variation and creativity
- **Resource Dependency**: Development depends on manually created linguistic resources (lexicon, grammar rules) before generation becomes possible
- **Computational Complexity**: As rule systems grow more sophisticated, computational efficiency may become a limiting factor

### 6.3 Validation Challenges

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Determining objective measures of "success" for generated linguistic artifacts remains an open research question
- **Human Assessment**: Reliance on human judgment for semantic coherence introduces subjective elements into the evaluation process
- **Cross-linguistic Validation**: Extending findings to other languages will require additional validation frameworks

These limitations inform our approach and highlight areas for future research development. Rather than undermining the project's value, they define its scope and establish boundaries for meaningful interpretation of results.

## 10. Theoretical Significance

This project serves as a foundational experiment in procedural linguistics and computational creativity, merging constructed language theory, linguistic formalism, and systems engineering. By employing Ido as the linguistic substrate, we leverage a simplified, regular, and fully ASCII-compatible syntax, providing methodological advantages for:

- Computational processing, parsing, and phrase construction
- Rule-based natural language generation (NLG)
- Cross-linguistic structural modeling
- Systematic exploration of meaning construction

Unlike Esperanto, which includes diacritical markers and morphological irregularities, Ido's consistent morphosyntax allows deterministic tokenization and grammar rule enforcement without preprocessing requirements—presenting an optimal environment for algorithmic manipulation and large-scale textual generation.

### 10.1 Broader Theoretical Implications

The long-term research agenda aims to establish a scalable methodology for:

- Designing linguistically valid sections of the conceptual Library of Babel
- Generating semantic, grammatical, and contextually coherent texts through algorithmic means
- Exploring the boundaries of meaning within constrained symbol spaces across constructed languages (Ido, Esperanto, Toki Pona, Lojban) and potentially natural languages

This investigation opens avenues for diverse linguistic and computational research directions:

- Formal complexity analysis of sentence structures across languages
- Combinatorial language saturation: quantitative assessment of meaningfully generatable sentences under specific grammatical constraints
- Development of semantic validation models using computational methods
- Low-noise linguistic environments for testing AI generalization capabilities
- Modeling emergent discourse properties from generative language systems
- Visualization and exploration of linguistic phase spaces—the set of all grammatically possible outputs under given constraints

This research establishes a methodological platform for linguistic experimentation at the intersection of human creativity, literary theory, and computational logic.
