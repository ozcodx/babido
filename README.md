# The Babel Library: Generative Linguistics Through Ido

A collaborative computational linguistics research project by **Oscar Eduardo Bernal** (B.Eng. Systems Engineering, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira) and **Luis David Cardona** (Linguistics, Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira, Colombia).

## Abstract

This interdisciplinary research project explores the intersection of computational linguistics, constructed languages, and procedural generation through the lens of Jorge Luis Borges' conceptual framework in *La Biblioteca de Babel* (1941). We propose a systematic approach to generating linguistically valid textual structures within the constraints of the Ido constructed language, employing deterministic algorithms to create reproducible linguistic artifacts that maintain grammatical coherence while exploring the boundaries of meaning construction.

## 1. Theoretical Framework

This investigation builds upon Borges' metaphorical infinite library containing all possible textual combinations. Rather than the random combinatorial approach in Borges' conception, we implement a constrained generative system bounded by:

1. The formal grammar of a constructed language (Ido)
2. Deterministic procedural generation algorithms
3. Structural linguistics principles
4. Computational approaches to meaning representation

> "The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries…" — *Jorge Luis Borges*

Our implementation represents a controlled subset of this conceptual space—a systematically navigable section of the infinite library that produces texts with increasing levels of linguistic validity.

## 2. Research Objectives

- **Primary Objective**: Develop a computational framework for generating grammatically well-formed linguistic structures in Ido using procedural algorithms.

- **Secondary Objectives**:
  - Formalize a deterministic methodology for reproducible sentence generation
  - Implement classification mechanisms for structure referencing and combinatorial composition
  - Develop scalable linguistic rule systems accommodating increased complexity
  - Evaluate the generated outputs through computational linguistic metrics
  - Explore semantic coherence within constrained generative parameters

- **Tertiary Objectives** *(future research)*:
  - Implement semantic validation through NLP techniques
  - Develop multi-level coherence from sentence to discourse structures
  - Create methods for thematic consistency across generated text sections
  - Establish quantitative metrics for evaluating procedurally generated linguistic artifacts

## 3. Methodological Selection: Ido as a Research Instrument

Ido, a constructed international auxiliary language derived from Esperanto, offers specific methodological advantages for this linguistic investigation:

### 3.1 Structural Characteristics

- **Regular Morphology**: Systematic and predictable word formation patterns
- **Consistent Grammar**: Rule-based structure without exceptions or irregularities
- **ASCII Compatibility**: Absence of diacritical marks or special characters (unlike Esperanto's circumflexes: ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ)
- **Simplified Phonology**: Clear grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence

### 3.2 Computational Advantages

- **Deterministic Parsing**: Unambiguous tokenization and syntactic analysis
- **Encoding Efficiency**: No requirement for Unicode normalization or special character handling
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Consistent representation across all computational environments
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Reduced complexity in pattern matching and text manipulation

### 3.3 Linguistic Properties

- **Morphological Regularity**: 
  - Uniform verb conjugation patterns
  - Systematic noun pluralization
  - Consistent adjective agreement
  - Regular derivational morphology

These properties establish Ido as an optimal experimental environment for computational linguistic research, offering a controlled space for investigating language generation without the statistical noise and irregularities inherent in natural languages.

## 4. Implementation Architecture

The system architecture comprises four primary components:

1. **Lexical Database** (`words.yaml`)  
   Hierarchical categorization of vocabulary by grammatical function and semantic domain, including:
   - Parts of speech classification
   - Morphological features
   - Semantic categorization

2. **Syntactic Templates** (`structures.yaml`)  
   Formalized generative structures with optionality markers:  
   ```
   {determiner?} {adjective?} {noun} {verb} {adverb?}
   ```
   Implemented with a domain-specific notation for structural variation.

3. **Morphosyntactic Rules** (`grammar.yaml`)  
   Formal implementation of:
   - Inflectional morphology
   - Agreement systems
   - Syntactic constraints
   - Combinatorial restrictions

4. **Generation Engine** (`sengen.py`)  
   Deterministic procedural generator utilizing cryptographic hashing for:
   - Reproducible sentence construction
   - Structural composition
   - Rule application
   - Coherence evaluation

## 6. Research Context

This investigation is conducted within the interdisciplinary research framework at the **Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira (UTP)**, Colombia, integrating methodologies from **Systems Engineering**, **Computational Linguistics**, and **Literary Studies**. The work contributes to emerging scholarship in procedural linguistics, computational creativity, and formal language theory.

## 7. Theoretical Significance

This project serves as a foundational experiment in procedural linguistics and computational creativity, merging constructed language theory, linguistic formalism, and systems engineering. By employing Ido as the linguistic substrate, we leverage a simplified, regular, and fully ASCII-compatible syntax, providing methodological advantages for:

- Computational processing, parsing, and phrase construction
- Rule-based natural language generation (NLG)
- Cross-linguistic structural modeling
- Systematic exploration of meaning construction

Unlike Esperanto, which includes diacritical markers and morphological irregularities, Ido's consistent morphosyntax allows deterministic tokenization and grammar rule enforcement without preprocessing requirements—presenting an optimal environment for algorithmic manipulation and large-scale textual generation.

### 7.1 Broader Theoretical Implications

The long-term research agenda aims to establish a scalable methodology for:

- Designing linguistically valid sections of the conceptual Library of Babel
- Generating semantic, grammatical, and contextually coherent texts through algorithmic means
- Exploring the boundaries of meaning within constrained symbol spaces across constructed languages (Ido, Esperanto, Toki Pona, Lojban) and potentially natural languages

This investigation opens avenues for diverse linguistic and computational research directions:

- Formal complexity analysis of sentence structures across languages
- Combinatorial language saturation: quantitative assessment of meaningfully generatable sentences under specific grammatical constraints
- Development of semantic validation models using computational methods
- Low-noise linguistic environments for testing AI generalization capabilities
- Modeling emergent discourse properties from generative language systems
- Visualization and exploration of linguistic phase spaces—the set of all grammatically possible outputs under given constraints

This research establishes a methodological platform for linguistic experimentation at the intersection of human creativity, literary theory, and computational logic.
